 cfp_artifact.0005.desc:0 "A difficult looking man demands an audience. \n\n"My name is [sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip].

 cfp_artifact.0006.desc:0 "[sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip] comes back with the product of his labor. You inspect the statue from head to toe. \n\n The folds of Mary's dress fall nicely and soberly. She holds Jesus in her arms and looks happy, full of grace. As your eyes falls on Jesus' face, you can't help but retch. His eye cavities are empty, his face and nose are simple lines. This is a terrible work and an insult to his holiness."
 cfp_artifact.0006.a:0 "I should have known, leave and never come back."
 cfp_artifact.0006.b:0 "How about you sculpt your nails in my dungeon ?"

 cfp_artifact.0012.desc:0 "My liege, I found this chess set at the local market. It looks rather basic but there's no missing pieces. \n\nI did not speak the tongue of the merchant who sold it to me but I think I figured out the rules. Hopefully this game will help us to take better decisions in battle."
 cfp_artifact.0013.desc:0 "My liege, as soon as you approved this idea, I managed to order a beautiful chess set to a foreign artisan. \n\nWhile it took a long time to gather the pigment, this chess set looks magnificent. I did not speak the tongue of the man and [steward.GetFullNameNoTooltipRegnal] could not find a translator. \n\nYet, I think I managed to understand the rules. This game will surely help us with the art of war."
